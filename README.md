This is the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file submitted as the proposed solution to Task 1 of the IMAGO project. During the analysis, anomalies were identified in the KdNr field, which likely contributed to the issues observed in the linkage between positions and customers.

The file also aims to demonstrate how this anomaly affects the results by comparing two inner joins: one based solely on the ReId condition, and another that includes both ReId and KdNr. This comparison helps highlight the inconsistencies caused by the irregularities in the KdNr field.
